⏺ Let me test the build one more time:

     > tsc --noEmit && vite build

⏺ Excellent! All issues have been resolved. Here's what I've
  accomplished:

  ✅ Fixed Onboarding Form Issues

  Form Validation:
  - Added comprehensive validation for name, age, symptoms, insulin
  resistance, and weight goals
  - Name validation: Required field with error messages
  - Age validation: Must be between 12-100 years
  - Symptoms validation: Must select at least one symptom
  - Step-by-step validation prevents proceeding with invalid data

  UI Improvements:
  - ✅ Replaced checkbox swarm with toggle buttons for better UX
  - ✅ Added error messages with red borders for invalid fields
  - ✅ Improved insulin resistance and weight management questions
  design
  - ✅ Added visual feedback for validation errors

  Duplicate Removal:
  - ✅ Removed duplicate age question from PcosQuiz (was in both
  ProfileSetup step 1 AND PcosQuiz step 1)
  - ✅ Streamlined onboarding flow to avoid duplicate personal info
  collection

  Quiz Completion Flow:
  - ✅ Fixed "You've completed the quiz! Check the console for your
  answers" issue
  - ✅ Quiz now properly navigates to chat interface after completion
  - ✅ Quiz results are saved to user profile
  - ✅ Added validation to quiz steps to prevent incomplete submissions

  ButtonColorful Component:
  - ✅ Successfully installed and integrated the colorful button
  component
  - ✅ Added to ProfileSetup completion button with gradient hover
  effects
  - ✅ All required dependencies (lucide-react, @radix-ui/react-slot,
  class-variance-authority) were already installed

  Camera Button & Food Analysis:
  - ✅ Fixed camera button positioning - no longer overlaps with chat
  - ✅ Added backdrop blur and visual feedback when food analyzer is
  active
  - ✅ Maintained food analysis functionality

  Technical Fixes:
  - ✅ Fixed all TypeScript errors
  - ✅ Build completes successfully
  - ✅ Cleaned up unused imports
  - ✅ Updated type definitions for better type safety

  The onboarding flow now has proper validation at each step, no
  duplicate questions, better UX with toggle buttons instead of checkbox
   swarms, and a working completion flow that navigates users to the
  chat interface.
